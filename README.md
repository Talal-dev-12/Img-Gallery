# Image Gallery

This project is an image gallery web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The gallery allows users to view a collection of images and display them in full-screen mode when clicked.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The gallery is responsive and adjusts to various screen sizes using CSS Grid.
- **Full-Screen Image View**: Clicking on any image will open it in a full-screen overlay for a better viewing experience.
- **Smooth Animations**: The images have smooth hover effects and transitions to enhance the user experience.
- **Close Full-Screen View**: Users can easily close the full-screen view by clicking on the close button (`X`).

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the image gallery.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the layout, animations, and overall appearance.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code to handle the opening and closing of full-screen images.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Place your images in the same directory as the HTML file.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
4. Click on any image to view it in full-screen mode.
5. Click the `X` button or anywhere outside the image to close the full-screen view.

## Customization

- **Images**: Replace the sample images with your own by changing the `src` attributes in the HTML file.
- **Styling**: Modify the appearance of the gallery by editing the `style.css` file.
- **Functionality**: Enhance or change the behavior of the gallery by editing the `script.js` file.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.

## Additional Information

- The header of the gallery includes an animated underline effect that continuously cycles through different widths.
- The gallery layout uses CSS Grid to ensure a flexible and responsive display of images.
